Master and Slave Nodes:-
----------------------------

Master node is nothing but a VM which performs the builds in jenkins pipeline and
 Slave node is nothing but a VM which is used to store the jobs results in it 
 

Master node  requires Tomacat,maven,git,java-17,jenkins,nexus,sonarqube....
 Slave node requires only git, java-17, maven
 

We use SSH Protocal to connect this Master node with the Slave node(s) in Jenkins.


 
 
Lets configure the Slave Nodes in Jenkins dashboard
-------------------------------------------------------


Adding Slave 1 in Jenkins dashboard
---------------------------------------

Jenkins dashboard ----> Build executor status (left pane bottom) ----> Currently you will "Built-in node" 
 
 which means it is a MASTER node ----> Click on "New Node" ----> Node name: slave1, Type: Permanent Agent 
 
 ----> Create ----> Name: slave1 ----> Description: This is Slave 1 ----> No. of executors: 3 (this is to run 
 
  number of builds parallelly) ----> Remote root directory: /tmp (In this path of slave nodes, the builds will 
  
  be stored) ----> Labels: slave1 (This label name is very important because this label name is the same name we

  should configure in the pipeline script. Based on this only, the job will get executed on whichever worker node

  we want) ----> Usage: Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node ----> Launch method: Launch 
  
  agents via SSH ----> Host: <PrivateIPofSlave1> ----> Credentials: Add: Jenkins ----> Scope: Global, Kind: SSH 
  
  username with private key, Scope: Global, ID: <Leave Blank> ,Description: <Leave Blank>, Username: ec2-user,

  Private key: Enter directly: Paste the entire content from pem file which is used to launch worker node 1 
  
  ----> Save ----> From the dropdown, select "ec2-user" ----> Host key verification strategy: Non verifying 
  
  verification strategy ----> Availability: Keep this agent online as much as possible ----> Save ----> 
  
  You can see Slave1 got added. Just refresh, you will see the values under free disk space, free temp space and

  other options available.
  
  
  

Adding Slave 2 in Jenkins dashboard
--------------------------------------

Jenkins dashboard ----> Build executor status (left pane bottom) ----> Currently you will "Built-in node" which 

 means it is a MASTER node ----> Click on "New Node" ----> Node name: slave2, Type: Permanent Agent ---->
 
 Create ----> Name: slave2 ----> Description: This is Slave 2 ----> No. of executors: 3 (this is to run number 
 
 of builds parallelly) ----> Remote root directory: /tmp (In this path of slave nodes, the builds will be stored)

 ----> Labels: slave2 (This label name is very important because this label name is the same name we should 
 
 configure in the pipeline script. Based on this only, the job will get execute on whichever worker node we want)

 ----> Usage: Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node ----> Launch method: Launch agents via

 SSH ----> Host: <PrivateIPofSlave2> ----> Credentials: From the dropdown, select "ec2-user" (Since both slave 
 
 nodes have same pem file, we can directly use the existing credentials. If its a different pem file, we have to 
 
 follow the process as we have followed in Slave 1) ----> Host key verification strategy: Non verifying 
 
 verification strategy ----> Availability: Keep this agent online as much as possible ----> Save ----> You can 
 
 see Slave2 got added. Just refresh, you will see the values under free disk space, free temp space and other

 options available.
 
 
 

This is the configuration of master and slave.
