It is used to automate the manual work which we need to perfom on daily bases.


Debug in shell scripting
===========================
It is nothing but showing the command along with the output while running a file
sh -x <filename.sh>

A shell script is always starts with shebang (#!/bin/bash)
Shebang is the first line write in a script and it will give the OS to use which type of interpreter should be used.

Single-Line comment :-
------------------------
It is making a single line not to execute by adding an "# symbol" at the starting
EX:- #This line is writing to print today date
      echo "Today date is: $(date)"

In-Line comment :-
--------------------
It is used to tell why we used a particular command after the command is given
EX:- echo "$(pwd)"   #This will giveme the present working directory

Multi-Line Comment:-

It is making multiple lines not to work in a file while execution of a script
<<(<any comment>)  (<< starting and ending comment should be same)
echo "this is new"
pwd
